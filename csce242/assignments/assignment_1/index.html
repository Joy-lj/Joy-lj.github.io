        <h1>About Succulents</h1>
        <h2>By Joy Jaroscak</h2>
        <p>If you are looking to buy a succulent for your first plant baby, they make amazing beginner house plants. They come in many shapes, colors, and sizes.
            They also do not require as much time and care as other house plants. I would definitely reccommend getting one if you are looking for a lower maintenance plant.
        </p>
        <p>A very popular succulent is the aloe vera. This plant is known for its medicinal properties and make for a great decoration. Another popular succulent is the cactus.
            This plant requires very little watering, however, watch out for its spikes.
