                        <h1>To Kill a Mockingbird</h1>
                        <h2>Harper Lee</h2>
                        <p>"To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer-Prize-winning novel written by Harper Lee and originally published in 1960. The book is widely regarded as an American classic and, until recently, was the only novel Lee had published. To Kill a Mockingbird was inspired by events and observations that took place in Lee's hometown. Set in the Great Depression, from 1932 to 1935, the novel is narrated by a young girl named Scout, whose coming-of-age experiences closely mirror Lee's.</p>
                        <p>To Kill a Mockingbird follows the lives of three children: Scout; her brother, Jem; and their friend, Dill. In the beginning, the novel focuses on the wild imaginations of the three children as they entertain themselves during the summer in Maycomb, Alabama. Maycomb is a quiet town with deep-seated social hierarchies based on race, class, and how long each family has lived there. Within their respective social groups, Maycomb's residents are closely-knit, to the point of being (both metaphorically and literally) incestuous, and gossip runs wild about any person who diverges from social norms (SuperSummary, n.d.)."</p>
